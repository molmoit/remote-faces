Images are just 72px square and only updated every two\n          minutes. They are so small that you can place the window all the time\n          near the left edge of your desktop. Images are sent each other in a\n          peer-to-peer manner and not stored anywhere. The link represents a\n          virtual room and all room members can see each other. Be careful not\n          to leak the link to unwanted person.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Opt-in Live Mode and Momentary Chat</h1>\n        <p>\n          In case you want to feel more connected, you can enable Live Mode and\n          your image become a video. If speaker and mic is activated, you can\n          talk with others who too enable the Live Mode. There is a chat area\n          next to face images where you can text. The chat is visible to all\n          members in the room. The chat history is only available until some\n          mebers are in the room. It will disappear if everyone close the room\n          in the browser. (Note: the link itself is still effective.)\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Other tools for collaboration</h1>\n        <p>\n          There is another area next to the chat area. Members can do\n          collaborative work there. Currently, there are three features are\n          included. 1) Screen Share: Share screen video of your desktop or\n          window. 2) Share Video: In addition to the small images, you can share\n          bigger images. This does not have to be the same webcam image. 3)\n          White Board: Powered by{\" \"}\n          <a\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n            href=\"https://excalidraw.com\"\n          >\n            Excalidraw\n          </a>\n          . This allows to work with a shared white board.
